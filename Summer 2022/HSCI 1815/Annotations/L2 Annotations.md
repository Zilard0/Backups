“Most historians have had little interest in alchemy, except to show how wrongheaded and unscientific it was. Only a few eccentrics continued to search for the philosophers’ stone, the fabulous substance that would change base metals into gold.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=14&annotation=TJQKIANA))

“Chemistry is not something that emerged from a prechemical past, to be defined once and for all.

“The pure, or philosophical, elements were never found in isolation, but always mixed with more or less of the other elements. Given this scheme, how were metals formed? Miners found them in the earth, where a natural process had imposed the qualities of metals on the original prime matter. Different metals represented different degrees of acceptance of these qualities” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=18&annotation=2C64TXUR))

““Jabir” linked Aristotle’s wet and dry exhalations with philosophical Mercury and Sulfur, which were different from and purer than the mercury and sulfur of the laboratory.

“Theory and practice were closely entwined for the Arabic alchemists of the eighth and ninth centuries. They asserted that every substance contained its opposite, in a hidden, or occult, way. Silver was cold and dry externally, but hot and wet internally. Gold was hot and wet externally, but cold and dry internally. In order to make gold one therefore needed to exchange the internal and external qualities of silver” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=20&annotation=4LMSRBAY))

“Geber’s writings also indicated that alchemical success was God-given, an attitude that reinforced the spiritual aspects of medieval alchemy.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=21&annotation=YX4ZA3K6))

“It is not surprising that in the following centuries, alchemy maintained its mixed reputation and wide embrace, encompassing both attempts at transmutation and what we would recognize as practical science” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=21&annotation=DF2E33CV))

“The yeoman’s tale includes a good deal of technical information, making it clear that the range of substances available to the alchemist had expanded greatly since Alexandrian times.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=22&annotation=88SSH56P))

“But in the sixteenth century there came an individual who had no interest in having his works attributed to past alchemists or physicians, as he was sure he was better than all of them. His unwieldy name was Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (), but he called himself Paracelsus as a way of claiming superiority to the great Roman physician Celsus” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=23&annotation=34PGIC6I))

“Medieval alchemists had generally adhered to a dyad theory, in which Sulfur and Mercury were the principles of all metals and change was produced by the interaction of these two principles” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=23&annotation=E3QHG7R9))

“Paracelsus took this dyad theory and added a third principle of Salt to it. His three principles—the tria prima, or three first things—were able to explain the alchemical transformations of all bodies. This material trinity matched the Holy Trinity in heaven as well as the three principles of which we are made: vital spirit, soul, and body.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=23&annotation=9ALGNSDN))

“Water was the primordial substance, within which sulfur and mercury somehow form distinct but inseparable parts. The mercury and sulfur could be rearranged, and so could mask or change the appearance of water.

“Alchemy began in antiquity, as a practical and a theoretical or philosophical pursuit. Combining theory and practice, it has to be taken seriously as science.

“His major contributions were twofold. First, he convincingly championed chemistry as an important part of the new natural philosophy of the seventeenth century. More precisely, Boyle argued that chemical philosophy and corpuscular philosophy provided important support for one another.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=27&annotation=Q69K6X32))

“In fifth century .., the Greek philosopher Leucippus invented a cosmology in which the world was described as made up of atoms moving in empty space. Democritus later took up and developed Leucippus’s theory. He portrayed a world in which an infinite number of eternally unchanging atoms moved in a vacuum, and, through their chance combinations, produced all the different bodies in the world and accounted for their qualities.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=28&annotation=VHEVWYCV))

“For Aristotle, explanation was above all an account of the causes of things and of the purposes that governed them. In a world made up of atoms moving at random and governed only by chance, how could one talk of cause and purpose? How could one really explain anything?

“Gassendi undertook the Christianization of atomism. Atoms, he explained, were not eternal but created by God.

“Boyle had a lifelong interest in philosophical Mercury, which he thought would dissolve the metals into their constituents. He believed that the philosophers’ stone existed and that it could serve as a universal medicine.

“how Stahl regarded atmospheric air. He viewed it as Becher had done, not as a chemical species but rather as a physical environment in which chemical phenomena may take place.

“Stahl’s answer was that plants absorb phlogiston from the air.
