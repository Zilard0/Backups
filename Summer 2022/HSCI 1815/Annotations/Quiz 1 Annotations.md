“Theory and practice were closely entwined for the Arabic alchemists of the eighth and ninth centuries. They asserted that every substance contained its opposite, in a hidden, or occult, way.

Basic about Paracelsus opinion on nature & alchemy

“Medieval alchemists had generally adhered to a dyad theory, in which Sulfur and Mercury were the principles of all metals and change was produced by the interaction of these two principles. Paracelsus took this dyad theory and added a third principle of Salt to it. His three principles—the tria prima, or three first things—were able to explain the alchemical transformations of all bodies. This material trinity matched the Holy Trinity in heaven as well as the three principles of which we are made: vital spirit, soul, and body.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=23&annotation=E3QHG7R9))
