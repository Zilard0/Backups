#### George Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707 - 1788)
* French Enlightenment Intellectual
* Studied law, math, and medicine
* Magnum opus: Histoire naturelle, generale et particuliere
	* 36 volumes, published 1749-1788 as a catalog for Jardin du Roi.
	* Appointed director of the Jardin du Roi by Louis XV in 1739
* Eloquent, even literary writing style
* Died in 1788
* Buffon was the director of the Jardin du Roi for 49 years
	* Set up in 1626 by Louis XIII as a botanical garden especially for medical plants.
* Massively expanded and transformed under Buffon's supervision.
	* Went from a botanical garden to an academic research institution.
	* Facilitated future work like that of Lamarck and Cuvier.

#### Buffon vs. Linnaeus
* Buffon aimed to replaced Linnaeus's theological explanations of life with naturalistic ones.
	* Example: Disagreement over the existence of species. 
* Buffon's favorite counter-example against design: The toucan
	* "The true charactersitics of nature's errors are disproportion joined to uselessness. All animal parts which are excessive, superabundant, or placed absurdly, and which are more detrimental than useful, should not be placed in the grand schemes of nature's imeediated "

* Buffon Theory:
	* All genera have their own internal mold
	* Molds give rise to different species depending on environment. 
	* Ancestral forms "degenerate" into local species.
		* Thomas Jefferson took offense to Buffon's claim that large mammals in the New World were degenerate descendants of those in the Old World.
	* **WAS NOT AN EVOLUTIONIST.**
	* Molds are fixed
	* Variation is reversible.
		* If you put tigers in Africa, over generations they will be become lions.
	* Focus on degeneration
		* Deviation from a "common ancestor" has a negative value.

#### Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829)
* French naturalist
	* Specialized in plants and invertebrates
* Colleague and rival of Cuvier at Jardin/natural history museum.
* Theorized that species were not fixed, but changed over time in accordance with natural laws.
	* Two mechanisms for transmutation of species: Dominant and Secondary
* Dominant mechanism:
* add from slides later

* YES, but not by post-Darwin standards.
* Write difference between Neo and Lamarck thoughts

#### Erasmus Darwin

* Physician and natural philosopher
	* Wrote about nature in both literary and scientific styles
	* Collaborated to translate Linnaeus into English
* Social-political radical
	* Abolitionist

* Zoonomia (1794-1796)
	* Technically a medical text, but included support for evolutionary ideas.
		* Transmutation of species toward improved forms.
		* Ancient common ancestor
		* Inheritance of acquired characteristics
