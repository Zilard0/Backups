## DNA History
### The Modern Synthesis (1930s - 1950s)
#### Mutationist Faction
* Recap: Rediscovery of Mendel
	* Hugo de Vries sees Mendel's work as supporting his own mutatiin theory.
* De Vries: No amount of continuous 

* William Bateson, 1861-1926
	* Interested in how Mendel's work showed discontinuous variation in traits
	* Became the great champion of Mendel in Britain
	* Coined terms like "Genetics," "homozygote," "heterozygote"

#### Biometrist Faction
* Francis Galton
	* Pioneered statistical analysis of variation in populations

* W.F. Raphael Weldon, 1860-1906
	* Darwinian biologist
	* Collected large amounts of field data to demonstrated the effects of selection on wild populations
	* Downplayed functional definitions of adaptation.


* Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866-1945)
	* pioneered fruit fly genetics
	* Started with the intention of studying experimental evolution
		* Restructured his lab to mapping fruit fly chromosomes
	* Mutations followed Mendelian patterns of inheritance
		* Segregated independently and appeared in ratios
	* Morgan did not connect mutation with selection, but his students did.
