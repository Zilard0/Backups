### Ideas about life on earth by the 1840s
* Continuous change
* Origins of species or types not restricted to one time period
* Change follows natural law; orderly organic transformation
* Environment affects changes in types
* Natural laws are universal.

### Charles Darwin, 1809-1882
* Son of an English gentleman, Robert Darwin, and his wife Susannah Wedgewood
* Had difficulty choosing a path in life
	* Trained to study medicine like his father, hated it.
	* Changed directions and studied at Cambridge to become a minister
* At Cambridge, Darwin became acquainted with botanists and geologists who sparked his interest in natural history.
* Went on the Voyage of the Beagle.
* Darwin hated Galapoes
* Darwin was fascinated by plant life across islands
	* Variation due to wind, animals bringing seeds
	* Variation present since island formed
	* Variation due to change over long periods of time


### The Finch Myth

* Darwin did not realize that finches were closely related species
* Darwin did not label which island his specimens came from
	* His servant did tho


### Natural selection
#### Reqs
* Trait variation
	* Begins with a lot of individual variation in traits
* Heritability of traits
	* Darwin and Wallace did not know how
* Different abilities to survive & reproduce
	* Depends on environment and competition. 


#### Basic Argument for natural selection
* Natural variation exists
* Variability causes changes from ancestral types
* "Struggle for existence" determines successful variation
* Some variations will not survive
* Speciation occurs through adaptation.
* Natural Selection causes transmutation of species to fit their environment.
* Analogy between artifical and natural selection
	* Animal breeder selects individuals with desired characteristics
	* Struggle for existence "selects" individuals best adapted to environment.

### Why did Darwin wait?
* Darwin was not trained as a naturalist
	* Knew the theory would be controversial and wanted to make himself as reputable as possible
	* Felt the need to have done extensive work on classifying species before making any radical claims about they develop
		* Wrote the book on barnacles
		* Conduced extensive research and consulted with animal breeders and pigeon fanciers
	* Drafts from 1842 and 1844 still struggled with how species diverged, a serious problem for the theory
	* Personal concerns

### Alfred Russel Wallace, 1823-1913
* Middle-class surveyor and naturalist
* Traveled to the Malay archipelago and Amazon basin (1848-1862)
	* Goal: Collect specimens to sell to collectors
* Published travel accounts 
* Influenced by geology (Lyell) and laws of population growth (Malthus)
* 1851 - Wallace's younger brother joined him in South America and died
* 1852 - Wallace returned to England, but lost his entire collection of specimens in a shipwreck
* 1853 - Wallace tries again, now going to Malaysia and Indonesia
* Wallace paper was then presented to the Linnean Society
	* along with Darwin's 1844 essay
	* and an 1857 letter from Darwin to Asa Gray


### Structure of The Origin
* Add quote
* Why start like this

#### Rhetorical strategies

#### Explanatory Power
* Broad outline of history of life forms
* Law of succession of types
* Biogeography
* Classification & Morphology
	* Relationships reflect common descent not archetypes
	* Homologies
	* Rudimentary organs
	* Embryology
