# L2 - The Scientific Revolution and the Rise of Modern Chemistry
Created:  [[2022-06-08]]
___
## New Sick Words
* Geocentrism: 
* Heliocentrism:
* Pre-modern in context of history: Before 1800
* modern in context of history: Starts 1800 after enlightenment 
* Humoral pathology: based on the idea that our bodies have four important fluids or humors--blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Because of this belief, humoral pathology is also called the "Hippocratic doctrine of four humors." Each humor is thought to have its own "complexion."
## Readings
* Levere, Ch. 2–3 (pp. 14–38) [24 pages].
* Boyle Skeptical Chymist (In class)
	* **Why did Boyle write and publish this?**
		* To critique the Aristotelian and Paracelsian theories and explain his point of view
	* **What were Boyle's critique of Aristotelian and Paracelsian theories?**
		* Fire doesn't seem to be a universal method of analysis
		* No way to know if products were present before heating -> are they elements?
		* You don't always get the same number of products
		* You do get new mixts
	* **How did Boyle come to his conclusions?**
		* Based on some experiments and examinations he did.

“The pure, or philosophical, elements were never found in isolation, but always mixed with more or less of the other elements. Given this scheme, how were metals formed? Miners found them in the earth, where a natural process had imposed the qualities of metals on the original prime matter. Different metals represented different degrees of acceptance of these qualities” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=18&annotation=2C64TXUR))

““Jabir” linked Aristotle’s wet and dry exhalations with philosophical Mercury and Sulfur, which were different from and purer than the mercury and sulfur of the laboratory. By purifying everyday mercury and sulfur and appropriately adjusting their proportions, the alchemist could make gold.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=20&annotation=9ZWBTIGS))

“Theory and practice were closely entwined for the Arabic alchemists of the eighth and ninth centuries. They asserted that every substance contained its opposite, in a hidden, or occult, way. Silver was cold and dry externally, but hot and wet internally. Gold was hot and wet externally, but cold and dry internally. In order to make gold one therefore needed to exchange the internal and external qualities of silver” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=20&annotation=4LMSRBAY))

“It is not surprising that in the following centuries, alchemy maintained its mixed reputation and wide embrace, encompassing both attempts at transmutation and what we would recognize as practical science” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=21&annotation=DF2E33CV))

“The yeoman’s tale includes a good deal of technical information, making it clear that the range of substances available to the alchemist had expanded greatly since Alexandrian times.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=22&annotation=88SSH56P))

“But in the sixteenth century there came an individual who had no interest in having his works attributed to past alchemists or physicians, as he was sure he was better than all of them. His unwieldy name was Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (), but he called himself Paracelsus as a way of claiming superiority to the great Roman physician Celsus” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=23&annotation=34PGIC6I))

“Medieval alchemists had generally adhered to a dyad theory, in which Sulfur and Mercury were the principles of all metals and change was produced by the interaction of these two principles” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=23&annotation=E3QHG7R9))

“Paracelsus took this dyad theory and added a third principle of Salt to it. His three principles—the tria prima, or three first things—were able to explain the alchemical transformations of all bodies. This material trinity matched the Holy Trinity in heaven as well as the three principles of which we are made: vital spirit, soul, and body.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=23&annotation=9ALGNSDN))

“Water was the primordial substance, within which sulfur and mercury somehow form distinct but inseparable parts.

“Alchemy began in antiquity, as a practical and a theoretical or philosophical pursuit. Combining theory and practice, it has to be taken seriously as science.

“His major contributions were twofold. First, he convincingly championed chemistry as an important part of the new natural philosophy of the seventeenth century. More precisely, Boyle argued that chemical philosophy and corpuscular philosophy provided important support for one another.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=27&annotation=Q69K6X32))

“In fifth century .., the Greek philosopher Leucippus invented a cosmology in which the world was described as made up of atoms moving in empty space. Democritus later took up and developed Leucippus’s theory. He portrayed a world in which an infinite number of eternally unchanging atoms moved in a vacuum, and, through their chance combinations, produced all the different bodies in the world and accounted for their qualities.” ([“Transforming Matter”, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/4MKW3B42)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BQVTCMV8?page=28&annotation=VHEVWYCV))

“For Aristotle, explanation was above all an account of the causes of things and of the purposes that governed them. In a world made up of atoms moving at random and governed only by chance, how could one talk of cause and purpose? How could one really explain anything?

“Gassendi undertook the Christianization of atomism. Atoms, he explained, were not eternal but created by God.

“Boyle had a lifelong interest in philosophical Mercury, which he thought would dissolve the metals into their constituents.

“Stahl’s answer was that plants absorb phlogiston from the air.

## Notes 
### The Scientific Revolution
Started anywhere between 1540 and 1740. Ended between 1650 and 1850. Also it depends on what you think is important, and is transformative. The scientific revolution changes our way of thinking, mainly a shift toward empiricism -> Type of questions & Sources of Authority. A lot of discovery voyages happened alot in this period, and a lot of institutions were created. Mechanical philosophy was also starting to develop. Lastly, Multiple conflicts within fields of study:
* Astronomy - Geo vs Helio
* Medicine - Theoretical vs Practical
* Natural History - Observation vs Manipulation

#### Important Figures
* Nicolaus Copernicus (1543)
	* Published De revolutionibus orbium coelestium
	* Influenced Kepler, Brahe, Galileo

### Theories of Matter

Timeline:
add later from slides

#### Pre-modern Elements (Before 1800)
* Prime matter that makes up all substances
* Often philosophical or theoretical in nature
* Corpuscles and atoms
	* Multiple versions of this
	* Provided mechanical explanations for composition/activity of matter
	* Corpuscles are divisible, atoms are not
	* Both describe characters of substances

#### Aristotelian Elements:
* Theoretical: Elements never exist on their own, but are mixed together in all matter.
* 4 elements
	* Water
	* Earth
	* Fire
	* Air
* 4 Qualities
	* Hot
	* Cold
	* Wet
	* Dry

Note: Add picture later.

####  Tria Prima
* Means three principles
* Structures around Paracelsus's ideas about disease and medical treatment -> Specific causes with specific treatments
* Paracelsian elements:
	* Sulfur (Fiery principle)
	* Mercury (Watery/liquid principle)
	* Salt (Earthy & solid principle)

#### Van Helmont's Willow Tree Experiment (1648):
* Add details later

#### The Skeptical Chymist Book (1661):
* Harsh critique of Aristotelian and Paracelsian theories of elements
	* Not based on experiemnts
	* do not hold up under scrutiny
	* Don't use clear, consistent language or define their paramters well
* Boyle subjecyed these theories to various tests
* Concladasda add later.
