## Concepts
### Heat, Energy, and Motion

#### Chemistry Recap
* Phlogiston theory included heat in its explanation for combustion
	* Elemernt theory had to find a new way to conceptualize heat
* Caloric explained heat release & absorption
* Allowed quantitative measurement


#### Sadi Carnot (1796-1832)
* French military engineer
	* Family was allied with Napoleon and suffered politically after his defeat
	* Died of cholera
	* Papers were burned for gear of contagion
* Theorized about maximum efficiency of heat engines
	* Inspired by British industry and steam engines
* Work was ingored in his time but later foundational to developing laws of thermodynamics

#### Carnot cycles - heat as caloric
* Caloric flows from a hot to a cold reservoir
* When the cylinder is brought into contact with a heat source the gas expands & pushes the piston up
* When the cylinjder is brought into contact with the heat sink, we push the piston down and compress the gas
* The work we get out during the expansion is more than the work we put in during compression
* So there is a net gain of work.


### Carnot add here stuff later


#### James Prescott Joule (1818-1889)
* One of the early pioneers of the modern view of heat as energy
* Son of an English brewer
* Inherited the brewery - Science was a hobby
	* Mentored by John Dalton
* Presented his ideas about heat to the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BASS) in 1847, caused a stir
* Modern unit of energy is named after him.

#### Joule's Paddle-wheel experiment
* Demonstrate that the mechanical work put into a system was convertted to heat
* Experimenter adds the energy requried to lift the weights
* As the weights fall, the paddle-wheel turns
* Temperature of the water increased


#### First Law of Thermodynamics
* Joule concluded that the energy in a system remained constant, but could be transferred as heat or work.
	* add law of conesrvation here
	* First proposed by Emilie du Chatelet in the 18th century
* In addition to Joule, the first law was developed independently by:
	* Hermann von Helmholtz, 1821-1894
	* Julius Robert Mayer, 1814-1878
	* Ludwig Colding, 1815-1888

#### William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, 1824-1907
* Born in Belfast, family moved to Glasgow
* Career as an electric telegraph engineer, including the transatlantic telegraph
* Opposed Darwin based on the calcualtions of the earth age -20 to 40 million years
	* A long time but not enough time for natural selection
* Unit of absolute temperature named for him
* Came across Carnot ideas on a trip to Paris in 1841 and was convinced
* Attended the talk by Joule in 1847 at BAAS, and his confidence was shaken
* Torn between Joule (Heat is converted to work) and carnot (Heat is conserved)
* Kelvin along with Rudolf Clausius demonstrated that Carnot's conclusions were still valid according to the laws of thermodynamics
* Didn't matter that he was working with the caloric model of heat: Math was right

#### Add second law stuff here

#### aDD HERE TOO

#### Kinetic Theory of gases
* Scientists attempeted to use Newtonian mechanics to derive a molecular theory of matter and heat from the 2nd law of thermodynamics
	* Ludwig Boltzmann
	* James CLerk Maxwell
* Conclusion: The second law of thermodynamics is a statistical law
	* It's vastly more probable for the atoms in a gas to get more disordered than they get more ordered


### Electrocity and Mangetism

* Add names here


ADD A LOT HERE
