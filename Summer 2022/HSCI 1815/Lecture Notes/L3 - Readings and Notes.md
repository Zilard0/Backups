## Notes 

### The English Civil War and the French Revolution

#### Overview
* Royalists vs. Parliamentarians
	* Conflict: What should be the balance of power be between the king and lords/property owners
* Over a century of religious tensions between protestants and Catholics
	* Stuart kings, James I and Charles I, under intense scrutiny for Catholic leanings in Protestant England


* King Charles married a catholic, was executed by parliamentarians
* Oliver Cromwell "Lord Protector," Died son deposed
* King Charles II, Monarchy restored, war over.


#### Social Consequences
* Deeply messy:
	* Much of the fighting was over small towns, castles, and manor houses
	* Battles didn't end until buildings crumbled
* Who is in charge?
	* Armies seized resources from towns and farms
	* Civilian crimes went unpunished
* In anything held sacred anymore?
	* Execution of a divine monarch was unthinkable until it happened
* Returned to monarchy in the end, so what was the point of all the violence?
	* Disillusioned idealists
	* Massive long-term political impacts, but that's difficult to see on the ground, at the time.


### The French Revolution (1789-1794)

#### Overview
* 18th century France ruled by the Ancien Regime, a feudalistic monarchy
	* King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie-Antoinette
* Representative body, Estates-General, could petition for laws but had no legislative power (and last met in 1614)
* Estates-General consisted of:
	* First estate - nobility
	* Second estate - Clergy
	* Third estate - Bourgeoisie & peasantry
	* First and second estate largely exempt from taxes
* 1788 - King Louis XVI reconvenes Estate-General to get new taxes authorized
* June 17, 1789 - Representatives of Third Estate ( Bourgeoisie and peasantry) walk out on the Estates-General, from National Assembly, and declare their intention to legislate
* July 14, 1789. Storming of the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority, followed by uprising of peasantry throughout France.
* 1792-1793 - Radical Jacobins take over
* Figurehead King Louis XVI tried for treason and guillotined
* War declared on Austria, England, Holland, and Spain 
* 1793-1794 - "Reign of Terror"
	* Lavoisier guillotined
* 1794 - Moderates gain control
* 1795 - France becomes a republic
* Never just a military or political revolution, but humanistic one
* Feudal system dismantled
	* King became a figurehead 
	* No more land owning nobles or clergy
* Restructured state relationship with Catholic Church
		* Church was targeted and even briefly replaced with "Cult of Reason"
		* Catholic hegemony ended
*  A new French identity:
		* Democratic political culture
		* "liberte, egalite, fraternite"
* England was very uncomfortable with the idea of revolution.

### Antoine Lavoisier vs. Joseph Priestley: Biographical Prologue

#### Antoine Lavoisier 1743-1794
* Grew up in Enlightenment
	* Age of Reason - Optimism that reason and science would improve the condition of mankind
	* Ground zero for Enlightenment philosophy: Paris
* Trained as a lawyer, with an interest in science
	* Hired by the French Academy of Science as an assistant chemist in 1768
* 1768 - Bought a share in Ferme Generale ("Tax farm") system
	* Collected taxes for the King and gain wealth through bonuses
	* Deeply unpopular among people who paid taxes
* Arrested in Nov 24, 1793 during the Reign of Terror
* Hauled before Revolutionary Tribunal along with other tax farms and guillotined on May 1794

#### Joseph Priestly (1733-1804)
* Unitarian, Anti-Anglican
* Studied theology at Daventry Academy, a dissenting/non-conformist academy:
	* Alternative to regular, Anglican universities like Oxford and Cambridge
* Held posts as a minister and taught at another dissenting academy
* Member of Birmingham Lunar Society, an intellectual club who9se members included James Watt, Erasmus Darwin, and Josiah Wedgewood
	* Fairly radical group
* Supporter of American and French Revolutions
	* Got his house burned down for it
* Moved to Pennsylvania, which is historically the reason for Pennsylvania.

**ADD MORE INFO**

### **ADD TITLE HERE LATEr**
#### Rewind: Boyle on air
* Air is elastic fluid
* Chemically active particles are floating in air
* Air itself is not chemically active
* Something is absorbed from the air in combustion and respiration
* Boyle ideas turned into "nitro-aerial theory" of combustion and respiration:
	* Robert Hooke
	* John Mayow add later
	* Mayow comes up with a mechanism
		* Air contains "nitrous particles" that are consumed by breathing or burning
		* Air loses its elasticity without these particles, flame/life is suffocated.
* Sounds like oxygen theory a hundred years early. However:
	* Mechanical, not chemical, process
	* Return to hypothetical principles a la paracelsus

#### Phlogiston Theory 
##### Johann Joachim Becher (1635-1682):
* add later

##### Georg Ernst Stahl (1660-1734)
* Physican and chemist
* Anti-mechanical chemistry
* Renames Becher's terra pinguis to phlogiston
* Still not elements!


* Unifying logic: A substance burning or rusting releases phlogiston
* Air absorbs expelled phlogiston
* Substances that burn must contain phlogiston
	* More phlogiston = easier to burn
* Calx - Simple metallic ore lacking phlogiston
	* This type of product is known as oxide by modern chemists
* Calcination is like "slow combustion" (burning)
* Smelting removes phlogiston from charcoal through heating and adds it to the calx.
* Trees absorb phlogiston from air.

Calcination
**Add equation later**

Smelting
**Add equation later**



#### Does phlogiston theory fit with Kyhn's definition of a paradigm
### Notes for organization later

#### Mixt vs aggregate
mixts are when the properties of the individual components change. 
Aggregates are things together

**Add qeustions from slides later**
