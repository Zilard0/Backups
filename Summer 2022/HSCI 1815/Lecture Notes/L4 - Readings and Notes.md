## Notes 

### Recap Phlogiston theory

Why cant you burn things in vacuum
Air needed to absorb phlogiston

Why does burning stop in clos3ed vessel

Air is saturated with phlogiston

How does phlogisticated air get dephlogisticated so that things can burn in it again?

Treeds

### Hales's pneumatic trough

* Allowed gas to be collected and measured
* Gas could be understood as a state of matter like liquid and solid
* Used by Joseph Black, Henry Cavendish, Joseph Priestly, and others to isolate and identify types of "air"
* Isolated by heating the red calx of mercury
* Identified the gas as a component of atmospheric air
* Described its properties
	* Eminently respirable
	* Revived asphyxiated mice
	* Supported combustion

#### Lavoisier "oxygen"
* Suspected since 1772 that air was consumed in combustion reaction.
* Made the connection between heat and gaseous states
* Repeated Priestley's experiment with the red calx of mercury
	* Initial results were unclear
	* Eventually figured out that the resulting gas was a component of atmospheric air.
* Combined with his previous ideas about acids and concluded that this component of air was the "acidifying principle"
	* Source of the oxygen name


#### Is it just about the name?

##### Priestley
* Isolated DPA as part of a larger investigation of novel "airs"
* Took several years to classify it as distnict
* Never let go of the phlogiston theory

##### Lavoisier
* Isolated oxygen using tests that Priestley came up with
* Took several years to recognize and classify it as distinct
* Never let go of the idea that oxygen was the "principle of acidity"

### Chemical Elements: Lavoisier, Dalton, and Priestley
#### How was it done?
* Used quantitative methods to demonstrate the inadequacy of phlogiston theory
* Created a system of standardized chemical nomenclature to replace the inconsistent naming conventions associated with phlogiston theory.
#### Lavoisier's Elements
* A functional category rather than a law of nature
* All provisional, and could be proven to be compounds in the future
* Atoms were more of a natural philosophical/metaphysical idea
	* Not something measurable
* "Ultimate elements" building blocks of nature were also metaphysical

#### John Dalton, 1766-1844
* Quaker, Dissenting religion like Priestley
* Not university trained in science or mathematics
* "The New Newton"
	* Britain needed a new scientific hero with Paris being the world capital of science in the early century
* Dalton untied corpuscular philosophy with simple substances to come up with atomic chemical elements
	* According to Lavoisier - Defined elements as the last point of analysis
	* Newton: Matter was made up of particles
* Key Question: If air is made up of different components, why are those components mixed instead of layered?
	* Mechanism of repulsion
	* Revied: Selective repulsion comes from different sizes and (weight ) of particles
##### Importance of Weight
* Dalton's conclusions:
	* All matter consists of tiny particles
	* Atoms are indestructible and unchangeable
	* Elements are characterized by the mass of their atoms
		* All atoms of the same element have the same mass
		* Atoms of different elements have different masses
	* When elements react, their atoms combine in simple whole number ratios:
		* Suggested a practical strategy for determining relative atomic weights from mass ratios in compounds.

#### How to organize all these elements?
##### Doberiner triads (1829)
* Sets of three elements with similar chemical properties and the atomic weight of the second element about half-way between that of hte first and the third.

##### Newlands' law of octaves (1865):
* Arrange known elements in order of atomic weight.
* After every seven elements you get a repetition of the first.

##### Dmitri Mendeleev: 
* Left blanks if necessary
* Predicated atomic mass (roughly) and chemical properties of missing elements
* Allowed for exceptions to ordering by atomic mass
