## Concepts
* LCAO-MO: a means of using atomic orbitals (on different atoms) to construct MOs for the entire molecule
* Overlap Integral: The degree to which atomic wavefunctions share a portion of the 3-d space
* Coulomb Integral: Used to calculate the classical electrostatic interaction energies among charged particles
* Exchange integral: Purely QM effect with unknown interpretation-but provide the net energy to make the bonding favorable.
___

### Hamiltonian for a Molecule
* Can be written by considering all electrostatic interactions
* The Born-Oppenheimer approximation suggests that we can often safely ignore the KE of any/all nuclei
* Multi-elecron systems are still a problem; we use $H^{+}_{2}$ as a solvable, one electron model system for molecules

### Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory
* Allows us to calculate wavefunctions for molecules
*
