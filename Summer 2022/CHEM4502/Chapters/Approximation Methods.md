# Approximation Methods
Created: [[2022-07-14]]
___
## Concepts
- **Basis Function**: A function used as a component for a trial wavefunction
- **Basis set**: The set of all basis functions used to construct a trial wavefunction

## Notes
### The Variational principle:
* Use: Provides a way of setting an upper limit on the approximated energy of a quantum system. However, we are only concerned with the minima due nature preferring minima
* Provide one or more optimizable parameters are being used here.
	- The energy can be improved with a better model wavefunction
	- the $N\times N$ secular determinant gives N energies, one for each unique MO wavefunction

### Basic Approach to Variational Principle Calculations
- Select a basis set (Or N basis functions)
- Calculate all possible $H_{ij}$ and $S_{ij}$ integrals (Minimum $N^{2}$ integrals)
- Find N values of E from the secular determinant
- Find the $c_{i}$ coefficients for $i$ corresponding to each value of E


### Huckel's Thoery
- Use: Provides a way to estimate the energies of conjugated (Organic) $\pi$ systems
- Considered to be a specific example of approximation in practice
- Assumptions:
	- Basis set: Unhybridized C 2p AOs perpinduclar to plane of molecule
	- Overlap integral: $S_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$ 
	- Resonance Integral:
		- $H_{ii}=\alpha=\text{-IE of }CH_{3}<0$
		- $H_{ij}=\beta=2E_{2p}-E_{\pi}<0$ for adjacent C atoms
		- $H_{ij}=0$ for non-adjacent C atoms 
	- Resonance Energy: a comparison of the $\pi$ energy of a conjugated system to that of ethylene. $E=2\alpha+2\beta$ for ethylene (2 electrons)
	 
### Basis Sets
- Collections of functions sued to represent AO wavefunctions for building LCAO-MOs 
- Usually composed of Gaussian functions, either alone or more commonly themselves linearly combined
- Core and valence AOs are typically modeled differently; in some basis sets, the core AOs are even modeled as a group
- Additional types of functions (i.e. diffuse and polarization) can be added to the bass set as desired
- Increasing the size of the basis set should lower the varitational energy

### Gaussian Basis Sets
- Predefined set of N functions to model AOs of an atom
- Linear combinations of Gaussian functions
- Parameterized and variationally optimized
- Pure H wavefunctions $\propto e^{-\alpha r}$
- Gaussian functions $e^{-\alpha r^{2}}$; do not model pure H functions very well.

### Contracted Gaussian functions
- Linear combinations of Gaussian functions are usually used
- Contracted Gaussian Functions (CGFs)
- Maintain the benefits of GTOs
- Better functions can be constructed from multiple Gaussians (Individual Gaussians are called primitive functions)
- The more Gaussians used, the better; N=3 and N=6 are common

### Computational Chemistry
- **Single $\zeta$ basis set:**
	- Each AO is represented by a single basis function 
	- Called minimal basis sets, as they contain the smallest possible number of basis functions
	- Since larger is usually better for basis sets, minimal basis sets are rarely used
	- STO-mG: minimal basis set, with m primitive per basis function
- **Multi $\zeta$ basis sets;**
	- Similar to minimal bases, except (some) AOs are represented by more than one basis function
	- Provide greater computational flexibility
	- Double $\zeta$ : two basis functions per AO
	- Triple $\zeta$ : three basis functions per AO
	- A multi $\zeta$ secular determinant is larger than a single $\zeta$ determinant of the same number of primitives, so flexibility comes at the expense of efficiency
- **Split valence basis sets**
	- Core orbitals: not involved in bonding, chemically "unimportant," represented by a single CGF
	- Valence orbitals: chemically important, must be treated more robustly; represented by multi-$\zeta$ functions
	- Famous Example: Pople-type basis sets (e.g. 6-31G):
		- Number before dash: Primitives per core function
		- Number of digits after dash: $\zeta$ number
		- Each digit represents number of primitives in each valence CGF
- **Correlation consistent basis sets (cc-PVXZ)**
	- Have become widely used in recent years
	- PV indicates polarized valence
	- Split valence in nature; X indicates the valence number (D=2, T=3, Q=4; 5 and 6 are also available)
	- Pople sets are usually parametrized with HF; cc-PVXZ are parametrized with more sophisticated computational models
- **Effective core potentials (ECPs)**
	- Heavy elements have many electrons, and are hard/time-consuming to treat
	- ECPs use simple functions to model electrostatic potentials generated by a nucleus and a number of core electrons
	- ECP basis sets are smaller because core electrons are not included
	- The core electrons replaced are often problematic, and removing them from a calculation is beneficial
	- **Types of ECPs**
		- Large core ECP: Has explicit functions only for valence electrons
		- Small core ECP: Has explicit functions for valence, n-1 electrons
- **Polarization Functions**
	- usually consist of $(l+1)$ -type functions
	- Allow electrons to better occupy "empty" spaces, and can therefore be quite important
	- Can be added to any basis set
		- Pople-type: designated by * or orbital designations (e.g. 6-31G* or 6-31G(d))
		- cc-type: Included in basis set definition
- **Diffuse Functions**
	- Have relatively large n values, better allow for electron density at a significant distance from the nucleus
	- Especially important for large atoms, anions, or other systems with loosely-bound electrons
	- Can be added to any basis set
		- Pople-type: designated by + (6-31+G)
		- cc-type: some diffuse functions are already present; additional ones added via aug prefix (aug-cc=PVDZ)
- **Multiconfigurational SCF (MCSCF or CASSCF)**
	- Considers more than one electron configuration for a  (All possible configs)
	- Generates a linear combination of configurations; analogous combining orbitals in MO theory
	- Employed by defining an "active space," or a number of electrons and set of orbitals in which they can be distributed
	- "CAS" in CASSCF stands for complete active space
	- Each configuration is a separate HF Calculation; MCSCF is quite expensive and difficult to employ
- **Configuration Interaction (CI)**
	- Full CI is MCSCF with all electrons and all orbitals; all configurations are considered
	- Full CI is the best calculation we do
	- CI can be truncated:
		- CIS (singles): one electron excitations; not useful for ground states, but useful for excited states
		- CID (doubles): two electron excitations; can be used for ground states
		- CISD: both single and double excitations
	- Full CI while theoretically good, is prohibitive to do for all but the smallest molecules
	- CI methods are not size consistent:
		- CIQ (quadruples) gives different energies than adding two analogous CID calculations
		- Size inconsistency is problematic when using truncated CI
- **Coupled Cluster (CC) methods**
	- Related but not identical to CI
	- Maintains size consistency
	- Is expensive, by can be truncated
	- CC methods
		- CCD: double excitations; implicitly gives $MP \infty$ energies
		- CCSD: singles and doubles
		- CCSDT: includes triple excitations, which are important for accuracy; very expensive
		- CCSD (T): includes simplified triples; is now often used as a gold-standard calculation 
- **Density functional theory (DFT):**
	- Not an ab inition method (HF-based), so there is no guarantee how results will behave
	- Based on the electron density (a real quantity), which Kohn and Sham used to calculate the total energy
	- The key feature is the QM exchange-correlation energy ($E_{xc}$), which must ultimately be approximated
	- In practice DFT is still done like SCF methods
	- Unlike HF, there is no inherent flaw in DFT, so it could be correct
	- Many versions of DFT have been developed:
		- All essentially differ in their means of estimating $E_{xc}$
		- Different methods typically have an exchange functional and a correlation functinal; one pairs two to get the full model (e.g. B+LYP=BLYP)
- **Hybrid Functionals (e.g. B3LYP): mix HF exchange with DFT exchange**
	- Not "pure" DFT, as they employ parameters which are often set
	- B3LYP is especially common; it usually strikes a good balance between efficiency/cost and accuracy

- **How does one select a method?**
	- Consider cost and system requirements; desired accuracy; time available; important properties

- **How does one compare methods?**
	- Many ways; one simple way is to compare results for the ionization energy of He



### Modern Implementations 
- Hartree-Fock self-consistent field (SCF) methods:
	- Model electron clouds using averaged electron densities, with the final solution achieved iteratively
- Semi-empirical: Use pre-defined integrals and basis sets to reduce requisite calculations; solutions are quicker but lower quality
- Perturbation theory: A solvable model is used as a starting point, with additional terms added to estimate differences between the model and the real complicated system
- MCSCF: SCF Calculations are performed for different electron configurations, and the results are themselves linearly combined; CI is MCSCF with all configuration considered
- CC: Similar to MCSCF, but formulated in a different and more reliable way
- Density functional theory: Fundamentally different than other methods, but in practice done in much the same way; based on electron density (rather than AOs) and not inherently flawed (But error-inducing approximations must still be made)

- **Note that one should always compare approximated results to known (preferably experimental) results as a test of quality**


### Hartree SCF
- Steps
	- Make initial guess wavefunctions for each electron
	- Build $h_{i}$ operators for each wavefunction
	- Solve Schrödinger equation for each wavefunction
	- Use new set of wavefunctions to generate new set of $h_{i}$
	- Repeat until wavefunctions converge
- Two major flaws
	- Electron-electron repulsion is double countered; can be corrected
	- Does not account for spin, indistinguishability; can be corrected using Slater determinants ala Fock (to give Hartree-Fock theory) and create Fock operators ($f_{i}$)

### Semiemprical methods (e.g. AM1, PM3)
- Modify HF theory and simplify integrals
- Small, predefined basis sets, adjustable parameters used to estimate certain types of integrals
- Parameter values chosen to recreate certain experimental results
- Relatively fast, applicable to large systems
- Accuracy is suspect (order of magnitude calculations)


### Pertrubation THeory
- Solutions are based on simple, solvable systems
- Simple systems are perturbed, resulting changes are determined
- Works best when perturbations re small
- Does not provide upper limits to energy (i.e. is not variational)
- Derivation summary
	- Write the Hamiltonian as a solvable function with an added perturbation $\hat H=\hat H^{(0)}+\hat H^{(1)}$
	- The wavefunction and energy can be written in simialr fashion 

$$\begin{align*}
&E=E^{(0)}+E^{(1)}+E^{(2)}+\dots\\
&\psi=\psi^{(0)}+\psi^{(1)}+\psi^{(2)}+\dots\end{align*}$$


We know or can find $\hat H^{(0)}, E^{(0)},\psi^{(0)}$



## Equations

### Trial Wavefunction
Use: Linear combination of simpler functions
$$\psi =\sum\limits_{i}c_{i}\phi_{i}$$
- $\phi_{i}$=Basis set (Collection of basis functions)
- $c_{i}$= Scales functions


### Variational Equation
Use: Approximated energies are always the upper limits to the real energy, and are calculated according the formula above:
$$E_{0}\leq \frac{\int\psi_{i}\hat H \psi_{i}dr}{\int\psi_{0}^{2}dr}$$
### The Secular Equation
Use: Relates the coefficients of trial wavefunctions to their energies

$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}(H_{ij}-ES_{ij})=0$$

- Determinant Format: 
$$
\begin{vmatrix}H_{11}-ES_{11}  & H_{12}-ES_{12} & \dots & H_{1N}-ES_{1N} \\ H_{21}-ES_{21} & H_{22}-ES_{22} & \dots \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\ H_{N1}-ES_{N1} &  &  & H_{NN}-ES_{NN}\end{vmatrix}=0
$$



### Perturbational Energies Eqn
Use: Calculated from unperturbed wavefunction and is a correction to Hamiltonian
$$E^{(1)}=\int \psi^{\star (0)} \hat H^{(1)} \psi^{(0)}$$

### Hartree Product Wavefunction Eqn
Use: The total wavefunction for a system is the product of the individual wavefunctions within it.
$$\Psi_{HP}=\phi_{1}\phi_{2}\dots \phi_{N}$$

### Hamiltonian of Entire System Using Hartree-Fock Methods Eqn
Use: The Hamiltonian of the entire system is the sum of one-electron Hamiltonian, which themselves describe an electon interacting with all nuclei and an average field from the other electrons
$$\hat H=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}h_{i}$$
$$h_{i}=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{i}^{2}-\sum\limits_{k=1}^{M}\frac{Z_{k}}{r_{ik}}+V_{i}\{j\}$$
$$V_{i}\{j\}=\sum\limits_{i\neq j}\int\frac{\rho_{j}}{r_{ij}}dr$$
- $h_{i}$ is the one electron Hamiltonian
- $M$ is the total number of nuclei present
- $Z_{k}$ is the charge of the $k^{t h}$ nucleus
- $\rho_{j}$: electron density of electron j

### Corrected Hartree SCF Formulas

$$\hat H=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}f_{i}$$
$$f_{i}=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{i}^{2}-\sum\limits_{k=1}^{M}\frac{Z_{k}}{r_{ik}}+V_{i}\{j\}$$


## Examples

7.6: ![[Pasted image 20220723181511.png|400]]
$$\hat H^{(0)}=-\frac{h^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}$$
$$\psi^{(0)}=\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}\sin\frac{n \pi x}{a}$$
$$E^{(0)}=\frac{h^{2}n^{2}}{8ma^{2}}$$
