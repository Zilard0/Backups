### Equations
#### Kinetic Energy of Photoelectron
$$eKE=hv- \phi =\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}$$
* $v$ = frequency of photon used to detach it
* $\phi$ = amount of energy need to remove it from its parent atom
* $m$ = mass of object
* $u$ = velocity of object

#### Rydberg Equation
Use: Describes the spectrum of atomic hydrogen
$$E= \frac{1}{\lambda}=Z^{2}R_{H}[\frac{1}{n^{2}_{i}}-\frac{1}{n^{2}_{f}}]$$
* $Z$ = nuclear charge
* $R_H$ = Proportionality constant
* $n_i$ = initial energy level of atom/ion
* $n_f$ = initial energy level of atom/ion
	* Note that hte energy of a wave can be expressed as the inverse of the wavelength, which gives them the units of $m^{-1}$ or $cm^{-1}$ , called wavenumber.
	* $E < 0 \textrm{ for emission}$ 
	* $E > 0 \textrm{ for absorption}$ 

#### Energy of Light
Use: Relates the energy of a light particle, or a photon to its frequency
$$E=hv$$
#### Bohr's Eqn for the radius and energy of an Electron for Hydrogen
$$r=\frac{4\pi\epsilon_{o}\hbar^{2}n^{2}}{m_{e}e^{2}} \qquad \qquad E=-\frac{m_{e}e^{4}}{8\epsilon^{2}_{o}h^{2}n^{2}}$$

* $\hbar$ = $\frac{h}{2\pi}$ 
* $n=1$ is the ground state (Lowest possible E)
* $n > 1$ is an excited state

#### Bohr's derived value of Rydberg Constant
$$R_{H}\approx \frac{m_{e}e^{4}}{8\epsilon^{2}_{o}h^{3}c}$$
* $c$ = speed of light

#### de Broglie Relationship
$$\lambda =\frac{h}{mu}$$
* **Note that $\lambda$ here refers to the wavelength of a particle**

#### Uncertainty of a particle's position and momentum.
$$\Delta x\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$
* Note that this has the smallest value compared to other similar equations
* These uncertainties has a minimum allowed value.
