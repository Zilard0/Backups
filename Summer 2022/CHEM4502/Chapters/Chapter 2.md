# Chapter 2
Created: ### [[2022-07-14]]


#### Waves
They are oscillatory functions

#### Quantum Mechanics:
* Treats electrons as waves
* based on the classical wave equation
* Boundaries: Restrict the infinite possible solution of a wave to the edges of interest.


### Chapter 2 Equations
#### Speed of Wave

$$c=v\lambda$$
* Not that it is not interchangeable with de Broglie Eqn!!

#### Wave's Frequency & Angular Frequency
$$v=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}$$
* $\omega$ = Angular Frequency

#### Classical Wave Equation
$$\frac{\partial^{2} f(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{\partial^{2} f(x,t)}{u^2\partial t^{2}}$$
* $u$ = speed of wave
* The solutions to the wave equation are either imaginary, zero, or sums of sines and cosines.
* Add picture here from video later
* 
#### Solutions to Classical Wave Equation

$$X(x)=c_{1}e^{i\beta x}+ c_{2}e^{i\beta x} = c_{3}cos{\beta x}+c_{4}sin{\beta x}$$
#### Solution to Temporal Portion of wave Equation
$$T(t)=c_{5}cos{\frac{un\pi t}{l}}+c_{6}sin{\frac{un\pi t}{l}}$$
* $n$ = integer
* $l$ = length of space

#### Total Wave Function Eqn
$$f_{n}(x,t) =X_n(x)T_{n(t)}\qquad \qquad f(x,t) =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n}(x,t)$$
