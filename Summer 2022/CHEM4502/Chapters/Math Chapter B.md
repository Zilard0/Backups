## Math Chapter B Eqns
#### Variance
$$\sigma^{2}= \langle x^{2}\rangle-\langle x \rangle^{2} \geq 0$$
### Discrete Distribution Eqns
#### Probability that the system exists between first and nth state
$$P=\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i$$
#### Probability if range includes all possibilities
$$1=\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i$$
#### Mean value over range 1 to n of a quantity associated with the operator $\hat A_{i}$ 
$$\langle \hat A \rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\hat A_{i}p_{i}$$


### Continuous Distribution Eqns
#### Probability that the system exists between a and b states
$$P=\int_{a}^{b}p(x)dx$$
#### Probability if range includes all possibilities (Normalized)
$$1=\int_{\text{all space}} Ap (x)dx$$
