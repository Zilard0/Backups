## Concepts
* Hybrid Orbitals: a linear combintation of AOs on a single atom; provide an intuitive description of chemical behavior

___

### VB Theory
* VB theory is similar to MO theory but easier to use in a more routine and less rigorous fashion
* VB theory is based on hybridization or the mixing of different AOs from the same atom
* VB theory is useful for predicting (**approximate**) molecular structure
* Molecular orbital theory accounts for shapes, but can be unwieldy; VB theory is another approach
* Hybrid orbitals can be written in LCAO for more traditional consideration as wavefunctions
* Hybrid orbitals can be formed from AOs with similar energy (2s and 2p for example)
* VB Theory can not adequately explain many quantitative experimental observations, most notably photoelectron spectra
* Number of HOs = Number of AOs

### MO theory for polyatomics
* Atomic orbitals do not explain molecular shapes
* can be thought of as hybridizing AOs from different atoms
* One way to approach sketching MOs is to consider AOs on the central atom, and use them to build bonding/antibonding interactions with atoms on the molecule's exterior
* There is no right or wrong set of MOs one can generate for a molecule, as long as they use all of the AOs one considers and there is an appropriate number of them (#MOs=#AOs)


### Example:
**10.1: $\color{bred}BeH_{2}$
* **Linear; can we predict this?**
* **Be is in the middle, so we only consider its HOs; hybridize the 2s and the 2p**
* **The result is two sp HOs***

### Tips for Drawing MOs from AOs
* What AOs to use? Also AOs used = MOs sketched
* Make bonding/antibonding pairs
* Hydrogen atoms/exterior atoms in groups 
* Sketch baby
