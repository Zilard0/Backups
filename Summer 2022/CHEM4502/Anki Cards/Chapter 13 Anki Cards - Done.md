Extra1:
* Transition energies correspond to the difference in energy between two rotational levels.
* The rotational constant describes rotational quantization
* Rotational spectra have lines spaced by (approximately) $2\tilde B$ 
* Rotational analysis can be improved by introducing a centrifugal distortion term

Extra2:
* Selection rules for pure rotational spectra
	* $\Delta J=\pm 1$ (Change in quantum number)
	* Molecule must have a permanent dipole moment

### Vibrational Spectra

Back: 
* Modeled by QHO


![[Pasted image 20220629231722.png|350]]

Extra1:
* Transition energies correspond to the difference in energy between two vibrational levels.
* The QHO is generally a poor model, which can be corrected by adding anharmonicity constant
* Polyatomic vibrational spectra can be understood as combinations of individual vibrations.
* Provide a way to measure force constants (Related to bond strength)
* Fundamental frequency: $v=0 \to v=1$ 
* Overtone frequency: $v=0\to v>1$
* Anharmonicity can be modeled with a Morse potential
Extra2:
* Most common types: IR and Raman
* IR Selection Rules
	* $\Delta v=\pm 1$
	* Vibration must cause a change in the dipole moment

* Number of Vibrations (Each vibration is unique):
	* Nonlinear molecules: 3N-6
	* Linear molecules: 3N-5
* The potential energy on a molecule is a function of the N vibrations, in case it was not affected by an external field
* If a normal coordinate produced a change in dipole moment, the vibration may be IR active

### Rovibrational Spectra


Back: 
* Display both rotational and vibrational transitions simultaneously
* Have two distinct sets of peaks (Called the R and P branches)
* Modeled using any combination of the following: RR, QHO, Corrected RR, and Corrected QHO
* Usually introduces a constant that accounts for the rotational impact of bond stretching (Rovibrational coupling constant)

Extra1:
* May exert a third (Q) branch for polyatomic molecules
* High frequency side ($\Delta J=+1$): R branch
* Low frequency side ($\Delta J=-1$): P branch
* In pure rotation spectra, $\Delta J =0$ is forbidden, so there is no peak at v itself (Some polyatomic vibrations have a line at v - The Q branch)
* P branch diverges and R branch converges
* Rotational constants depend on the vibrational level.
Extra2:
* Types of bonds:
	* Parallel band: Vibrations occur along the primary molecular axis; normal selection rules apply
	* Perpendicular band: Vibration occurs perp to primary axis; $\Delta J \text{ is allowed}$

### Electronic Spectra

Back: 
* Involve transitions between electron configurations
* Difficult to generally model
* May include vibrational and rotational transitions; Called (Ro)vibronic spectra
* Has intensities governed by Franck-Condon rules

![[Pasted image 20220630020558.png||600]]


Extra1:

* Include photoelectron spectra, which provide proof for orbitals.
* Rotational spacings are usually too small to observe; vibrational+ electronic = Vibronic spectra

### Franck-Condon Intensities


Back: 
* Electronic transition intensities depend on wavefunction overlap (Including vibrational wfns)
* Large changes in geometry give many vibronic peaks; small changes give few
Extra1:
* Selection rule: No change in the number of unparied electrons
* Vibrations not observed by IR, pure rotational spectroscopy
