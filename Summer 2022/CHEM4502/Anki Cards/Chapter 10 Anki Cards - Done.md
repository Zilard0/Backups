### MO theory for polyatomics
* {{c1::Atomic orbitals do not explain molecular shapes}}
* can be thought of as {{c1::hybridizing}} AOs from different atoms
* One way to approach sketching MOs is to consider {{c1::AOs}} on the central atom, and use them to build bonding/antibonding interactions with atoms on the molecule's exterior
* There is {{c1::no right or wrong set of MOs}} one can generate for a molecule, as long as they use all of the AOs one considers and there is an appropriate number of them (#MOs=#AOs)
