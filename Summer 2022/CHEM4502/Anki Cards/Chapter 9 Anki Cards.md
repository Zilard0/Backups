### Hamiltonian for a Molecule
* {{c1::Can be written by considering all electrostatic interactions||
* {{c1::The Born-Oppenheimer approximation suggests that we can often safely ignore the KE of any/all nuclei}}
* {{c1::Multi-electron systems are still a problem; we use $H^{+}_{2}$ as a solvable, one electron model system for molecules}}

### Born-Oppenheimer approximation
* {{c1::Nuclei move slow compared to electrons, so we assume they are fixed in space}}
* {{c1::R is a parameter}}
* {{c1::Wavefunctions obtained are not exact, but can be improved iteratively}}

### Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory
* {{c1::Used to construct molecular wavefunctions }}

 Energy of Wavefunction for a molecule:
 {{c1::
	 $$E=\frac{\int\psi^{*}\hat H\psi dr}{\int\psi^{*}\psi dr}$$
}}
* {{c1::$E_{+}$}} is more stable than separated fragments, leads to chemical bond
* {{c1::$E_{-}$ }}is less stable than separated fragments, does not lead to chemical bond
* {{c1::J}} is repulsive, {{c1::K}} is attractive
* Bonding can only be explained with {{c1::K}}, and is therefore only adequately described by QM
* {{c1::$E_{+}<E_{-}$}}, so ground state has a bond at every R

### Types of MOs
* {{c1::$\sigma$}}: contains electron density on the internuclear axis
* {{c1::$\pi$}}: contains one nodal plane inclusive of internuclear axis
* {{c1::$\delta$}}: contains two nodal planes inclusive of the internuclear axis
* {{c1::Bonding}}: Has no nodal planes perpendicular to the bond axis and between the nuclei
* {{c1::Antibonding}}: Has at least one nodal plane perpendicular to the bond axis and between the nuclei
* {{c1::Nonbonding}}: Do not have AO contributions from both adjacent atoms
* $\sigma_{g}$: bonding, $\sigma_{u}$: Antibonding, $\pi_{g},\delta_{u}$: Antibonding, $\pi_{u},\delta_{g}$: Bonding (Not as important but still deserve a quick glance)
