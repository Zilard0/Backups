#### Kinetic Energy of Photoelectron
{{c1::

$$eKE=hv- \phi =\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}$$
* $v$ = frequency of photon used to detach it
* $\phi$ = amount of energy need to remove it from its parent atom
* $m$ = mass of object
* $u$ = velocity of object

#### Rydberg Equation
Use: {{c1::Describes the spectrum of atomic hydrogen}}

{{c1::
$$E= \frac{1}{\lambda}=Z^{2}R_{H}[\frac{1}{n^{2}_{i}}-\frac{1}{n^{2}_{f}}]$$
* $Z$ = nuclear charge
* $R_H$ = Proportionality constant
* $n_i$ = initial energy level of atom/ion
* $n_f$ = initial energy level of atom/ion
	* Note that hte energy of a wave can be expressed as the inverse of the wavelength, which gives them the units of $m^{-1}$ or $cm^{-1}$ , called wavenumber.
	* $E < 0 \textrm{ for emission}$ 
	* $E > 0 \textrm{ for absorption}$

#### Bohr's Eqn for the radius and energy of an Electron for Hydrogen

{{c1::
$$r=\frac{4\pi\epsilon_{o}\hbar^{2}n^{2}}{m_{e}e^{2}} \qquad \qquad E=-\frac{m_{e}e^{4}}{8\epsilon^{2}_{o}h^{2}n^{2}}$$

* $\hbar$ = $\frac{h}{2\pi}$ 
* $n=1$ is the ground state (Lowest possible E)
* $n > 1$ is an excited state
