* Paragraph 2:
* Paragraph 3:
	* The relative rates of increase among the different racial, economic and religious elements in our complex population are deeply significant for the future anthropological composition of the American people. They are no less significant for the relative persistence among us of sharply contrasted social traditions, religious, economic and political. Nothing is clearer in these matters that that each class or sect tends to perpetuate its own traditions and standards of life. New England, once the stronghold of Unitarianism and congregationalism is now being rapidly dotted with Catholic churches, Irish, Polish, French Canadian, and Italian. Immigration stands in the background of these and associated changes (http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/view_image.pl?id=1598) (Para 3.1 & 3.2)
	* "the tragic theme that civilization comes solely from white blood and that it always perishes when black blood comes in, or stagnates when yellow blood mingles with Caucasian strains." (Para 3.3) (http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/image_header.pl?id=1301&printable=1&detailed=0)
* Paragraph 4:
	* "One race must drive out the other or be absorbed. * * * The time has come when we must look the facts in the face and discard our sentimental point of view in favor of drastic measures; and, unless some remedy is found, the nation is doomed to mongrelism" (Para 4.1) ()
* Paragraph 5:
