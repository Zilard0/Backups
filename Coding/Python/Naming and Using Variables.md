### Naming and Using Variables
* Variables names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. 
* They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a **number**
* **Spaces** are not allowed in variable names.
* Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.
* Variable names should be short but descriptive!
