### Strings
* One of the datatypes in Python
* A **string** is a series of characters, where anything inside single quotes **'**, and double quotes **"** is a string.

Examples:
```python
'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'  
"The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."  
"One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community."
```
