### Changing Case in a String with Methods
Methods are actions that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot after the variable name implies that the method will act on that variable.
* **.title()** method: Changes each word to title case, where each word starts with a capital letter.

```python
name = "ada lovelace"  
print(name.title())

//Output
Ada Lovelace
```

* **.upper()** = change to upper case.
```python
name = "Ada Lovelace"  
print(name.upper())  
print(name.lower())  

//This will display the following:  
ADA LOVELACE  
ada lovelace
```
* **.lower()** = change to lowercase.
```python
name = "Ada Lovelace"  
print(name.lower()) 

//This will display the following:   
ada lovelace
```
